1. **Basic Statistical Measures**:
```
Mean (μ) = (1/n) ∑(xᵢ)              // Average participation rate
Standard Deviation (σ) = √[(1/n-1) ∑(xᵢ - μ)²]  // Measure of spread
Median = middle value when sorted    // Robust measure of central tendency
```

2. **Distribution Shape Metrics**:
```
Skewness = (1/n) ∑[(xᵢ - μ)/σ]³     // Measures asymmetry
- Value of 2.38 indicates strong right skew
- Positive value means tail extends to the right
```

3. **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**:
```
KDE(x) = (1/nh) ∑ K((x - xᵢ)/h)
where:
- K is the Gaussian kernel: K(u) = (1/√2π) exp(-u²/2)
- h is bandwidth (smoothing parameter)
- n is sample size
```

4. **Histogram Construction**:
```
Bin Width = 5% (fixed intervals)
Frequency = (count in bin / total count) × 100%
```

5. **Threshold Analysis**:
```
Low Participation (ρₗ) = 10%
High Participation (ρₕ) = 40%
Below ρₗ % = (count < 10% / total count) × 100%  // = 78.3%
Above ρₕ % = (count > 40% / total count) × 100%  // = 10.9%
```

**What These Tell Us**:

1. **Central Tendency**:
   - Mean (11.7%) >> Median (3.4%)
   - Large difference indicates non-normal distribution
   - Median more representative of "typical" DAO

2. **Variability**:
   - σ = 22.4% shows high variability
   - Range spans from 0% to ~85%
   - Large spread indicates diverse participation patterns

3. **Distribution Shape**:
   - Strong positive skew (2.38)
   - Most DAOs cluster at low participation
   - Long tail extends to high participation rates
   - KDE smooths the distribution for continuous view

4. **Participation Categories**:
   - Most DAOs (78.3%) have low participation (<10%)
   - Small fraction (10.9%) achieve high participation (>40%)
   - Clear concentration in lower ranges

**Statistical Implications**:
- Non-normal distribution suggests need for non-parametric tests
- High skewness indicates potential outliers or special cases
- Clear thresholds might need refinement based on empirical distribution -- this could cause change in respect of my paper 
- Large variance suggests heterogeneous DAO participation patterns



# Network Participation KPI Analysis Summary

## Overview of Visualizations

### 1. Scatter Plot Distribution (Figure 1)
**Purpose**: Visualizes relationship between community size and participation rates.
**Structure**:
- X-axis: Community size (log₁₀ scale)
- Y-axis: Participation rate (%)
- Reference lines: ρₗ=10%, ρₕ=40%

**Statistical Measures**:
```
μ = 11.65%  // Mean participation
σ = 22.43%  // Standard deviation
Median = 3.35%  // Central tendency
IQR = [0.61%, 7.17%]  // Interquartile range
```

**Key Findings**:
- Large discrepancy between mean and median indicates skewed distribution
- No clear correlation between community size and participation
- Most DAOs cluster in low participation region

### 2. Basic Histogram (Figure 2)
**Purpose**: Shows frequency distribution of participation rates.
**Structure**:
- X-axis: Participation rate intervals
- Y-axis: Relative frequency (%)
- Bin width: Fixed intervals (0-1%, 1-5%, etc.)

**Statistical Measures**:
```
Q1 = 0.6%  // First quartile
Median = 3.4%  // Second quartile
Q3 = 7.2%  // Third quartile
```

**Key Findings**:
- Highest concentration in lowest participation bins
- Clear right-skewed distribution
- Natural breaks differ from theoretical thresholds

### 3. KDE Histogram (Figure 2.1)
**Purpose**: Combines histogram with kernel density estimation.
**Structure**:
- Histogram bars: Frequency distribution
- Red line: KDE curve
- Reference lines: Current thresholds

**Statistical Measures**:
```
KDE Formula: KDE(x) = (1/nh) ∑ K((x - xᵢ)/h)
where:
K = Gaussian kernel
h = bandwidth parameter
n = sample size

Skewness = 2.38  // Measure of distribution asymmetry
```

**Key Findings**:
- Strong right-skew confirmed by skewness value
- Density estimation shows continuous distribution pattern
- Most mass concentrated below 10% threshold

### 4. Threshold Analysis (Figure 3)
**Purpose**: Empirical analysis for threshold optimization.
**Structure**:
- Current thresholds (red)
- Proposed thresholds (black)
- Fine-grained histogram bins

**Statistical Measures**:
```
Current Categories:
- Low: <10% (78.3% of DAOs)
- Medium: 10-40% (10.9%)
- High: >40% (10.9%)

Proposed Categories (based on quartiles):
- Very Low: <0.6%
- Low: 0.6-3.4%
- Medium: 3.4-7.2%
- High: >7.2%
```

## Overall Statistical Approach

1. **Descriptive Statistics**:
```python
mean = sum(rates) / n
std = sqrt(sum((x - mean)² for x in rates) / (n-1))
quartiles = sorted_rates[n * [0.25, 0.5, 0.75]]
```

2. **Density Estimation**:
```python
bandwidth = 1.06 * min(std, IQR/1.34) * n^(-1/5)  # Silverman's rule
kde = sum(gaussian_kernel(x - xi, bandwidth) for xi in rates) / n
```

3. **Distribution Analysis**:
- Histogram binning
- Quartile-based thresholds
- Skewness calculation

## Key Conclusions

1. **Current Thresholds**:
- Too broad for actual distribution
- Miss natural breaks in data
- Group too many DAOs in "low" category

2. **Proposed Refinements**:
- More granular categorization
- Data-driven thresholds
- Better discrimination power

3. **Statistical Evidence**:
- Strong right-skew (2.38)
- Large gap between mean and median
- Clear natural breaks at quartiles
