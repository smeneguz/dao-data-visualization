# Distribution Analysis of DAO Treasury Values: A Statistical Approach

## Overview
This analysis examines the distribution of treasury values across Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), using advanced statistical methods to understand the concentration and spread of financial resources.

## Data Characteristics
- **Sample Size**: N = 50 DAOs
- **Near-zero Cases**: 14 DAOs (28.0%)
- **Value Range**: $2.9e-3 to $2.2e+11 USD

## Statistical Methods Used

### 1. Core Statistical Measures
- **Geometric Mean**: $2.01e+2
  - Used instead of arithmetic mean due to log-normal distribution
  - More appropriate for highly skewed financial data
  - 95% Confidence Interval: [$5.58e+0, $7.24e+3]

- **Median**: $8.98e+4
  - Robust measure of central tendency
  - Less sensitive to extreme values
  - Better represents "typical" DAO treasury size

- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: [$1.00e-6, $5.98e+6]
  - Robust measure of spread
  - Contains middle 50% of the data
  - Shows extreme variability in treasury sizes

### 2. Advanced Statistical Measures

#### Distribution Shape Parameters
- **Skewness (γ₁)**: -0.61
  - Negative value indicates left-skewed distribution in log space
  - Suggests concentration at higher values after log transformation

- **Kurtosis (γ₂)**: -1.38
  - Negative value indicates lighter tails than normal distribution
  - Suggests fewer extreme outliers than expected

#### Robust Statistics
- **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)**: 2.377 log₁₀ units
  - Robust measure of variability
  - Less sensitive to outliers than standard deviation
  - Confirms high variability in treasury sizes

### 3. Visualization Methods

#### Histogram Construction
- **Bin Width**: 6.936 log₁₀ units
  - Optimized using Freedman-Diaconis rule
  - Accounts for data spread and sample size
  - Formula: 2 × IQR × n^(-1/3)

#### Density Estimation
- **Adaptive Kernel Density Estimation**
  - Uses Gaussian kernel
  - Adapts bandwidth locally
  - Provides smooth representation of distribution

### 4. Category Thresholds
- **Low**: < $100M (94.0% of DAOs)
- **Medium-Low**: $100M-$1B with < 50% circulation (0.0%)
- **Medium-High**: $100M-$1B with ≥ 50% circulation (4.0%)
- **High**: > $1B (2.0%)

## Key Findings

1. **Extreme Concentration**
   - 94% of DAOs have treasuries below $100M
   - Only 2% exceed $1B
   - Significant number (28%) have near-zero treasuries

2. **Distribution Characteristics**
   - Highly skewed in natural scale
   - Log transformation reveals structured distribution
   - Large gap between mean and median indicates extreme values

3. **Treasury Size Categories**
   - Clear dominance of small treasuries
   - Very few DAOs in medium categories
   - Minimal representation in high category

## Statistical Significance
- Confidence intervals suggest high uncertainty in mean estimation
- MAD indicates substantial variability even within size categories
- Distribution shape metrics confirm non-normal distribution

## Conclusions

1. **Financial Concentration**
   - Extreme inequality in treasury distribution
   - Most DAOs operate with relatively small treasuries
   - Few "whale" DAOs control substantial resources

2. **Methodological Implications**
   - Log transformation essential for analysis
   - Robust statistics provide better insights than traditional measures
   - Multiple statistical approaches needed for comprehensive understanding

3. **Category Effectiveness**
   - Current threshold at $100M might be too high
   - Consider revising category boundaries based on empirical distribution
   - Potential need for more granular low-value categories

## Recommendations
1. Consider redefining treasury size categories based on empirical distribution
2. Implement additional analysis of near-zero treasury cases
3. Investigate correlation with other DAO metrics
4. Consider longitudinal study to track treasury evolution
