# Voting Efficiency Analysis in DAOs: Statistical Methodology and Results

## 1. Overview
This analysis examines voting efficiency in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) through two complementary visualizations focusing on distribution analysis and efficiency categorization.

## 2. Data Characteristics
- **Sample Size**: N = 34 DAOs
- **Primary Metrics**:
  * Proposal Approval Rate (ρₐ)
  * Average Voting Duration (τ)
- **Data Filtering**:
  * Approval Rate ∈ [0, 100]%
  * Duration > 0 days
  * Removed invalid entries

## 3. Figure 1: Distribution Analysis

### 3.1 Methodology
**Core Metrics Calculation**:
```
Approval Rate (ρₐ) = (Approved Proposals / Total Proposals) × 100%
Average Duration (τ) = Σ(Voting Duration per Proposal) / Total Proposals
```

**Statistical Measures**:
```
Mean (μ) = Σxᵢ/n
Standard Deviation (σ) = √(Σ(xᵢ - μ)²/(n-1))
Confidence Interval = μ ± (1.96 × σ/√n)  # 95% CI
```

### 3.2 Results
**Distribution Parameters**:
- Approval Rate:
  * μ = 61.4%
  * σ = 29.2%
  * CI = [51.6%, 71.2%]

- Voting Duration:
  * μ = 7.0 days
  * σ = 8.3 days
  * CI = [4.2, 9.8] days

### 3.3 Categorical Analysis
```
Low: ρₐ < 30% ∨ τ < 2 days
Medium: 30% ≤ ρₐ ≤ 70% ∧ 2 ≤ τ ≤ 14 days
High: ρₐ > 70% ∧ 2 ≤ τ ≤ 14 days
```

### 3.4 Distribution Results
- Low Efficiency: 23.5%
- Medium Efficiency: 17.6%
- High Efficiency: 32.4%
- Outliers: 26.5%

## 4. Figure 2: Efficiency Analysis

### 4.1 Correlation Analysis
**Pearson Correlation Coefficient**:
```
r = Σ((x - μₓ)(y - μᵧ)) / √(Σ(x - μₓ)² × Σ(y - μᵧ)²)
where:
x = approval rates
y = durations
μₓ, μᵧ = respective means
```

**Result**: r = -0.23 (weak negative correlation)

### 4.2 Efficiency Zones
1. **High Efficiency Zone** (Green):
   - ρₐ > 70%
   - 3 ≤ τ ≤ 14 days
   - 32.4% of DAOs

2. **Medium Efficiency Zone** (Orange):
   - 30% ≤ ρₐ ≤ 70%
   - 3 ≤ τ ≤ 14 days
   - 17.6% of DAOs

3. **Low Efficiency Zone**:
   - ρₐ < 30% ∨ τ < 2 days
   - 23.5% of DAOs

4. **Duration Outliers**:
   - τ > 14 days
   - 11.8% of DAOs

## 5. Statistical Significance

### 5.1 Confidence Intervals
- Used Student's t-distribution (n < 30)
- 95% confidence level
- Calculated as: CI = μ ± tₐ × (σ/√n)
  where tₐ = 2.045 (df = 33)

### 5.2 Hypothesis Testing
H₀: No correlation between approval rate and duration
H₁: Correlation exists
- t-statistic = r√((n-2)/(1-r²))
- p-value > 0.05 (fail to reject H₀)

## 6. Key Findings

1. **Distribution Characteristics**:
   - Right-skewed duration distribution
   - Bimodal approval rate distribution
   - Significant variance in both metrics

2. **Efficiency Metrics**:
   - One-third (32.4%) achieve high efficiency
   - Notable proportion (11.8%) exceed duration bounds
   - Weak negative correlation between metrics

3. **Statistical Robustness**:
   - Wide confidence intervals suggest high variability
   - Sample size (N=34) adequate but not optimal
   - Normal distribution assumptions partially met

## 7. Conclusions

1. **Metric Independence**:
   - Weak correlation (r = -0.23) supports dual-metric approach
   - Independent thresholds justified statistically

2. **Threshold Validation**:
   - Current thresholds effectively segment population
   - Duration bounds capture 88.2% of cases
   - Clear differentiation between categories

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Consider duration-weighted approval rates
   - Investigate outlier causes
   - Monitor temporal trends

# Comprehensive Analysis of DAO Voting Distribution: Statistical Methodology and Results

## 1. Introduction and Context

### 1.1 Research Objective
This analysis examines the distribution of proposal approval rates in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), aiming to:
- Understand voting pattern distributions
- Identify statistical properties of governance participation
- Evaluate effectiveness of current thresholds
- Propose evidence-based categorization

### 1.2 Data Characteristics
- Sample Size: N = 50 DAOs
- Metric: Proposal Approval Rate (%)
- Range: [0, 100]%
- Time Period: [specified period]

## 2. Statistical Framework

### 2.1 Fundamental Distribution Metrics

#### 2.1.1 Central Tendency Measures
```python
# Arithmetic Mean (μ)
μ = (1/n)Σxᵢ = 53.9%
where:
- xᵢ = individual approval rates
- n = sample size (50)

Interpretation:
- Center point of distribution
- Equal weight to all observations
- Sensitive to extreme values
```

#### 2.1.2 Dispersion Measures
```python
# Standard Deviation (σ)
σ = √((1/(n-1))Σ(xᵢ - μ)²) = 35.0%

Interpretation:
- Measure of spread around mean
- Large value indicates high variability
- Units match original data (%)
```

#### 2.1.3 Confidence Interval
```python
# 95% Confidence Interval
CI = μ ± (z × (σ/√n))
   = 53.9% ± (1.96 × (35.0/√50))
   = [44.2%, 63.6%]

where:
- z = 1.96 (95% confidence level)
- σ/√n = standard error of mean

Interpretation:
- Range containing true population mean with 95% probability
- Wider interval indicates less precision
- Used for statistical inference
```

### 2.2 Distribution Shape Analysis

#### 2.2.1 Skewness (Third Moment)
```python
# Standardized Third Moment
Skewness = (1/n)Σ((xᵢ - μ)/σ)³ = -0.28

Interpretation:
- Negative value: left-skewed distribution
- -0.28 indicates slight asymmetry
- Values between -0.5 and 0.5 considered nearly symmetric
```

#### 2.2.2 Kurtosis (Fourth Moment)
```python
# Excess Kurtosis
Kurtosis = ((1/n)Σ((xᵢ - μ)/σ)⁴) - 3 = -1.40

Interpretation:
- Negative: flatter than normal distribution
- -1.40 indicates significant flatness
- Suggests multiple modes or uniform spread
```

### 2.3 Density Estimation Techniques

#### 2.3.1 Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
```python
# Gaussian Kernel Density Estimator
KDE(x) = (1/nh)Σᵢ K((x - xᵢ)/h)

where:
K(u) = (1/√(2π))exp(-u²/2)  # Gaussian kernel
h = bandwidth parameter
```

#### 2.3.2 Bandwidth Selection
```python
# Silverman's Rule of Thumb
h = 1.06 × σ × n^(-1/5) = 16.955

Rationale:
- Optimal for approximately normal data
- Balances smoothing and detail
- Adaptive to data scale
```

### 2.4 Distribution Functions

#### 2.4.1 Probability Density Function (PDF)
```python
# Empirical PDF (histogram)
PDF(bin) = (count in bin)/(n × bin width)

Shown on:
- Left Y-axis (0-24%)
- Black bars in visualization
- Represents local density
```

#### 2.4.2 Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
```python
# Empirical CDF
CDF(x) = (1/n)Σᵢ I(xᵢ ≤ x)

where:
I() = indicator function

Shown on:
- Right Y-axis (0-100%)
- Blue line in visualization
- Represents accumulated probability
```

# Analysis of DAO Voting Efficiency Thresholds - 3rd diagram 

## Overview

This document analyzes the comparison between theoretical (paper-defined) and empirically derived thresholds for DAO voting efficiency, based on data from 34 DAOs.

## Data Characteristics

- **Sample Size**: N = 34 DAOs
- **Key Metrics**:
  * Approval Rate Range: 0-100%
  * Duration Range: 0-14 days
- **Distribution Parameters**:
  * IQR Approval: [42.9%, 87.8%]
  * IQR Duration: [3.0, 6.7 days]

## Statistical Framework

### 1. Current Paper-defined Thresholds
```
Low Efficiency:
- Approval < 30% OR duration < 2 days
- Population: 29.4% of DAOs

Medium Efficiency:
- 30% ≤ Approval ≤ 70% AND 2-14 days duration
- Population: 29.4% of DAOs

High Efficiency:
- Approval > 70% AND 2-14 days duration
- Population: 41.2% of DAOs
```

### 2. Empirically Derived Thresholds
```
Low Efficiency:
- Approval < Q₁ (42.9%) OR duration thresholds
- Population: 29.4% of DAOs

Medium Efficiency:
- Q₁ ≤ Approval ≤ Q₃ with optimal duration
- Population: 50.0% of DAOs

High Efficiency:
- Approval > Q₃ (87.8%) with optimal duration
- Population: 20.6% of DAOs
```

## Statistical Methods

### 1. Distribution Analysis
- Skewness: -0.45 (slight left skew)
- Kurtosis: -1.12 (platykurtic distribution)
- Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for smoothed distribution visualization

### 2. Effectiveness Rate Calculation
```python
def calculate_effectiveness(bin_data):
    # Smoothed effectiveness with Bayesian adjustment
    effective_proposals = count_within_duration_bounds(bin_data)
    total_proposals = len(bin_data)
    
    alpha = 1  # Smoothing parameter
    return (effective_proposals + alpha) / (total_proposals + 2*alpha)
```

### 3. Threshold Determination
```python
# Empirical thresholds based on quartile analysis
Q1 = np.percentile(approval_rates, 25)  # 42.9%
Q3 = np.percentile(approval_rates, 75)  # 87.8%

# Duration bounds from IQR analysis
duration_lower = max(2, np.percentile(durations, 25))  # 3.0 days
duration_upper = min(14, np.percentile(durations, 75)) # 6.7 days
```

## Key Findings

### 1. Threshold Comparison
- Paper thresholds (30%, 70%) are more lenient than empirical ones
- Empirical thresholds suggest higher standards for both categories
- Optimal duration range is narrower than paper-defined range

### 2. Category Distribution
- Paper framework creates relatively balanced categories
- Empirical framework shows concentration in medium category
- High efficiency threshold is more stringent in empirical framework

### 3. Effectiveness Analysis
- Clear correlation between approval rate and voting duration
- Most effective proposals fall within 3-7 day duration range
- Higher approval rates correlate with optimal duration periods

## Visual Components

### 1. Distribution Elements
- Black bars: Frequency distribution of approval rates
- Red line: Kernel density estimation curve
- Blue line: Smoothed effectiveness rate

### 2. Reference Lines
- Red lines: Paper-defined thresholds (30%, 70%)
- Blue lines: Empirical thresholds (Q₁, Q₃)
- Effectiveness scale on right axis (0-100%)

## Conclusions

### 1. Threshold Validity
- Paper thresholds provide simple, round-number boundaries
- Empirical thresholds better reflect actual DAO behavior
- Both frameworks identify similar proportion of low-performing DAOs

### 2. Recommendations
- Consider raising low threshold to ~40%
- Adjust high threshold based on context (~85%)
- Narrow optimal duration range to 3-7 days
- Implement context-specific adjustments

### 3. Implications
- Current thresholds may underestimate DAO performance
- Empirical framework provides more balanced categorization
- Duration bounds could be tightened for better efficiency

## Statistical Notes

### 1. Methodology Considerations
- Used Kernel Density Estimation for distribution smoothing
- Applied Bayesian smoothing to effectiveness rates
- Employed quartile-based threshold determination

### 2. Limitations
- Sample size (N=34) suggests cautious interpretation
- Potential temporal variations not captured
- Context-specific variations may exist

### 3. Future Work
- Longitudinal analysis of threshold stability
- Investigation of context-specific variations
- Integration with other performance metrics
