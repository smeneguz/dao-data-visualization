# Voting Efficiency Analysis in DAOs: Statistical Methodology and Results

## 1. Overview
This analysis examines voting efficiency in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) through two complementary visualizations focusing on distribution analysis and efficiency categorization.

## 2. Data Characteristics
- **Sample Size**: N = 34 DAOs
- **Primary Metrics**:
  * Proposal Approval Rate (ρₐ)
  * Average Voting Duration (τ)
- **Data Filtering**:
  * Approval Rate ∈ [0, 100]%
  * Duration > 0 days
  * Removed invalid entries

## 3. Figure 1: Distribution Analysis

### 3.1 Methodology
**Core Metrics Calculation**:
```
Approval Rate (ρₐ) = (Approved Proposals / Total Proposals) × 100%
Average Duration (τ) = Σ(Voting Duration per Proposal) / Total Proposals
```

**Statistical Measures**:
```
Mean (μ) = Σxᵢ/n
Standard Deviation (σ) = √(Σ(xᵢ - μ)²/(n-1))
Confidence Interval = μ ± (1.96 × σ/√n)  # 95% CI
```

### 3.2 Results
**Distribution Parameters**:
- Approval Rate:
  * μ = 61.4%
  * σ = 29.2%
  * CI = [51.6%, 71.2%]

- Voting Duration:
  * μ = 7.0 days
  * σ = 8.3 days
  * CI = [4.2, 9.8] days

### 3.3 Categorical Analysis
```
Low: ρₐ < 30% ∨ τ < 2 days
Medium: 30% ≤ ρₐ ≤ 70% ∧ 2 ≤ τ ≤ 14 days
High: ρₐ > 70% ∧ 2 ≤ τ ≤ 14 days
```

### 3.4 Distribution Results
- Low Efficiency: 23.5%
- Medium Efficiency: 17.6%
- High Efficiency: 32.4%
- Outliers: 26.5%

### 4.1 Correlation Analysis
**Pearson Correlation Coefficient**:
```
r = Σ((x - μₓ)(y - μᵧ)) / √(Σ(x - μₓ)² × Σ(y - μᵧ)²)
where:
x = approval rates
y = durations
μₓ, μᵧ = respective means
```

**Result**: r = -0.23 (weak negative correlation)

### 4.2 Efficiency Zones
1. **High Efficiency Zone** (Green):
   - ρₐ > 70%
   - 3 ≤ τ ≤ 14 days
   - 32.4% of DAOs

2. **Medium Efficiency Zone** (Orange):
   - 30% ≤ ρₐ ≤ 70%
   - 3 ≤ τ ≤ 14 days
   - 17.6% of DAOs

3. **Low Efficiency Zone**:
   - ρₐ < 30% ∨ τ < 2 days
   - 23.5% of DAOs

4. **Duration Outliers**:
   - τ > 14 days
   - 11.8% of DAOs

## 5. Statistical Significance

### 5.1 Confidence Intervals
- Used Student's t-distribution (n < 30)
- 95% confidence level
- Calculated as: CI = μ ± tₐ × (σ/√n)
  where tₐ = 2.045 (df = 33)

### 5.2 Hypothesis Testing
H₀: No correlation between approval rate and duration
H₁: Correlation exists
- t-statistic = r√((n-2)/(1-r²))
- p-value > 0.05 (fail to reject H₀)

## 6. Key Findings

1. **Distribution Characteristics**:
   - Right-skewed duration distribution
   - Bimodal approval rate distribution
   - Significant variance in both metrics

2. **Efficiency Metrics**:
   - One-third (32.4%) achieve high efficiency
   - Notable proportion (11.8%) exceed duration bounds
   - Weak negative correlation between metrics

3. **Statistical Robustness**:
   - Wide confidence intervals suggest high variability
   - Sample size (N=34) adequate but not optimal
   - Normal distribution assumptions partially met

## 7. Conclusions

1. **Metric Independence**:
   - Weak correlation (r = -0.23) supports dual-metric approach
   - Independent thresholds justified statistically

2. **Threshold Validation**:
   - Current thresholds effectively segment population
   - Duration bounds capture 88.2% of cases
   - Clear differentiation between categories

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Consider duration-weighted approval rates
   - Investigate outlier causes
   - Monitor temporal trends
